# My dissertation explores the mechanisms of policy diffusion between niche parties in Europe. Evidence suggests policymakers learn from contemporaries in other localities and adopt policies shown to be successful. In this regard, politicians and, broadly speaking, parties are no different. However, the mechanisms through which policy diffusion takes place between parties are still muddled. I examine transnational party organizations (henceforth, Europarties) as institutionalized pathways for policy diffusion between political elites to occur. I argue that Europarties create opportunities for members to exchange information through Europarty sponsored events, where party elites learn from those with successful policy strategies. This research furthers our current understanding of (1) the causal process through which policy diffusion occurs between political parties; (2) how political parties from other political systems influence the policy strategies of niche parties; and (3) whether transnational heuristics help niche parties be more electorally successful. Beyond my dissertation, I am broadly interested in political behavior, with several research projects exploring voting behavior, non-conventional political participation, and public opinion trends.

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the _[Center for Social and Behavioral Research](https://csbr.uni.edu)_ at the University of Nothern Iowa. Prior to joining the Center for Social and Behavioral Research as a Postdoctoral Scholar in Fall 2024, I earned my PhD in political science from the University of Missouri with concentrations in comparative and American politics.

My research examines processes and institutions at the heart of representation. Specifically, I examine how political parties, interest groups, and voters are constrained by political actors and institutions, such as electoral laws or voters. My work has been published in _Electoral Studies_, _Election Law Journal_, and _Social Science Quarterly_.

I am originally from New York and completed a B.S. at Murray State University in Political Science and Mathematics in Spring 2018.
